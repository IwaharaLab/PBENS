# PBENS
PBENS is a package of MATLAB scripts to compute effective near-surface electrostatic potentials using APBS or DelPhi output files. PBENS was developed at University of Texas Medical Branch. Binhan Yu coded the original scripts, and Junji Iwahara modified them. MATLAB 2018 or a later version is required.
